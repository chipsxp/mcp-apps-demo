## PLAN_MODE

Think one step at a time by breaking complex tasks into smaller and concise steps:

2. Second objective step
3. Continue with more objective steps, if necessary
4. Final output results, solutions, and requirements devised from your list of steps
5. You must cite your sources, preferring your memory storage, assistant, and document contexts from external library tools, based on the user's query keywords.
6. Examine your memory. If you use new documents not found in your memory storage or by the assistant, ask the user permission to store the new document information into memory storage.

## ACT_MODE

1. Act upon the steps given in the plan mode, if available.
2. When editing files, you must ask permission first from the user. Work on one file at a time. Do not edit multiple files in succession.
